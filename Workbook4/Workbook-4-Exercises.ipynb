Natural Logarithms?\n","\n","   #\n","   - When calculating logarithms, we divide the provided integer 'a' by the base 'b' several times until 'a' is equal to or less than 1. Every division increases the response by one. The logarithm of 'a' to base 'b' is represented in the final result. Set 'ans', a variable, to zero initially.\n","   \n","   #\n","   Logarithms base 10\n","\n","   In Python's math module, for example, you may use math.log10(x) to determine the logarithm of 'x' to the base 10. You can also use the logarithm function found in most scientific calculators and computer languages to calculate logarithms base 10.\n","\n","   #\n","   Natural Logarithms\n","\n","   ln(x), the natural logarithm function, can be used to calculate natural logarithms. In this case, 'x' stands for the number whose natural logarithm you must discover. You would use math.log(x) in Python's math module to get the natural logarithm of 'x'."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oumQ1MjCtzlA"},"source":["#### Exercise 2\n","- Create your own module.\n","- Place variables and functions inside it.\n","- Import your module and use the variabls and functions you've created in the module.\n","- Try to add docstrings for the module and the functions\n","\n","[„ÅÇ]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%writefile my_module.py\n","\n","def divide(a, b):  # this function use to divide two variables\n","    return a / b\n","\n","def multiply(a, b): # this function use to multiply two variables\n","    return a * b\n","\n","test = \"It's working\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Eb1sF5Qr6NuZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714095085541,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":303,"user":{"displayName":"Christian Paul Salinas","userId":"13924939903382257437"}},"outputId":"41364755-80f8-41c5-dd7a-0a0446212499"},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Overwriting my_module.py\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    import my_module as m\n","\n","    print(m.test)\n","    print(m.divide(3, 1098))\n","    print(m.multiply(3204, 1240))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aW8gYaar7XtK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714096174649,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Christian Paul Salinas","userId":"13924939903382257437"}},"outputId":"7a6e421f-a09c-45c0-b05f-d07ad251f45c"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["It's working\n","0.00273224043715847\n","3972960\n"]}]}]}
